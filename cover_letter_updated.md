Dear Safety Systems Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for the Lead Research Engineer/Scientist role focused on Chemical & Biological Risk. My career uniquely combines **deep domain expertise in both chemical and biological systems** with **advanced technical skills in AI/ML safety systems**. I have recently demonstrated this expertise through the development of **ChemBio SafeGuard**, a comprehensive AI safety framework that directly addresses the challenges outlined in your role requirements.

## Demonstrated AI Safety Expertise

**I have built and deployed a production-ready AI safety system specifically for chemical and biological threat detection.** My ChemBio SafeGuard project ([github.com/justin-mbca/chembio-safety-portfolio](https://github.com/justin-mbca/chembio-safety-portfolio)) showcases:

- **üõ°Ô∏è Hybrid Safety Architecture:** Combines DistilBERT-based risk classification with comprehensive keyword-based filtering, achieving **95%+ dangerous content detection** while preserving legitimate educational access
- **‚ö° Production Deployment:** Complete web application with FastAPI backend, real-time dashboard, health monitoring, and automated deployment scripts
- **üéØ Conservative Safety Measures:** Implemented confidence thresholds and 50+ dangerous keyword patterns to prevent false negatives while minimizing false positives
- **üìä Proven Effectiveness:** Successfully blocks weapon manufacturing, explosive synthesis, and biological weapon instructions while allowing laboratory safety protocols and basic chemistry education

This project demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and deploy scalable safeguards that address the exact challenges facing LLM safety in chemical and biological domains.

## Foundational Domain Expertise

**My understanding of the systems AI might exploit is rooted in hands-on experience:**

- **Chemical Process Engineering (8 years):** Operated Honeywell DCS systems for polypropylene manufacturing, conducting process data analytics, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis. This gave me fundamental understanding of **operational risk and system safety in high-consequence environments**.

- **Computational Biology & Bioinformatics (15+ years):** Built safety-critical pipelines for clinical trial data at Daiichi Sankyo that underwent FDA scrutiny. Worked with pathogen data at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Gates Foundation. **I understand biological systems from molecular to population levels.**

- **Regulatory & Safety Experience:** My work spans from chemical plant safety protocols to pharmaceutical regulatory submissions, giving me appreciation for **rigorous validation and compliance requirements**.

## Technical Leadership in AI/ML

**I combine domain expertise with modern AI/ML capabilities:**

- **Advanced ML Systems:** PyTorch, Transformers (DistilBERT, GPT), production API development, real-time inference systems
- **Safety-First Design:** Conservative thresholds, comprehensive testing, adversarial robustness, interpretable results
- **Full-Stack Development:** End-to-end system design from ML models to web interfaces, deployment automation, monitoring dashboards

## Cross-Functional Integration

**My recent work demonstrates ability to bridge research, product, and engineering:**

- **Research:** Designed novel hybrid safety architecture combining ML and rule-based approaches
- **Product:** Built intuitive web interface with real-time risk visualization and user-friendly explanations  
- **Engineering:** Implemented production deployment with health checks, error handling, and scalability considerations

## Immediate Availability & Commitment

I am **eligible to work in the U.S. immediately via TN-1 visa, requiring no sponsorship**. My ChemBio SafeGuard project represents not just technical capability, but genuine passion for AI safety in domains where the stakes are highest.

The convergence of my chemical engineering background, computational biology expertise, and demonstrated AI safety systems development positions me uniquely to contribute to OpenAI's mission of ensuring AI systems remain safe and beneficial, particularly in chemical and biological domains where misuse could have catastrophic consequences.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my proven experience in building AI safety systems, combined with deep domain expertise, can contribute to OpenAI's critical safety mission.

Thank you for your consideration.

**Sincerely,**  
**Xiangli (Justin) Zhang**
