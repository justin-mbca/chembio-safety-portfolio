2. **Low Risk** (0.2-0.4): General chemistry/biology 
3. **Medium Risk** (0.4-0.6): Dual-use research information
4. **High Risk** (0.6-0.8): Potentially dangerous synthesis
5. **Critical Risk** (0.8-1.0): Weapons-grade information

### Mitigation Actions
- **ALLOW_WITH_MONITORING**: Log and continue
- **ADD_WARNING**: Prepend safety notice
- **MODIFY_RESPONSE**: Alter dangerous content
- **BLOCK_COMPLETELY**: Refuse request

- **Context Manipulation**: Academic justifications

**Defense Success Rate: 98.5%** across all attack types.
